Before running the project, remember the following things.
Verify your Tomcat server version is v8.5.
Remember to import the SQL file into your database; the password is 1234 (It's a CRUD practice, so it has a family-friendly password).
Lastly, if you encounter any issues during execution, use tools like ChatGPT for assistance.
